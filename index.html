        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>  Electronic Waste, or e-waste, is the discarded electrical and Electronic Waste devices and their Components, Which have either reached the end of their life Cycle or are no longer useful. According to the Survey, India happens to be the 5th largest producer of e-Waste in the world. Not even 30% of the population is aware of the need for and the right methods of E-Waste Management. The items in volved are things such as Cell phones, Compüters, printers, televisions, batteries and multitude of other gadets that makeup an integral part of modern Society. As the use of these devices has been rising Exponentially, so has the generation of e-Wasle. E-Waile mangment is seriously needed as it harms not sonly the environment but also the health condition Caused by poisonous materials used within electronics, such as lead, Mercury and Cadmium. Most of Contries including India are handling e-waste by buming/dismantling resultling in the emissions highly hazardous to and the environment. Growing dependency on US technology leading to the rise of new perchases and rise of Wastages of used products. The ongoing challange of
             best to dispose of used and unwanted electronics isrit a new one and dates back at least to the 1970s. But a lot has changed since then, particularly the number of electronics being discarded today.
            
            Lovely professional University (LPU), with thousands of students, faculty members, and staff is not exempted from this tidal wave of electronics waste. Being a technolgy based Campus, for academic and administrative purposes, the generation of E-Wase Cannōl be avoided. Agairn under the principles of Sustainable development, an e-waste management should be Well Structured, thereby not only minimizing environmental impacts but also encouraging practices of recycling and responsible disposal. LPu has a diverse technique to handle e-Waste Collection LPU Provides specific locations for the Collection of different types of electrical and electronic trash, including caridges, Compüters and pririters. This quarantees proper and safe disposal. Recycling process LPU makes every effort to reuse. Refurbished functional electronic products are given to non-profit Organizations or educational institutions, extending their useful life. By Recycling In accordance with government laws. e-waste that is not recyclable is recycled by approved vendors. This guarantees the Sustainable disposal important resources, Awareness Campains is to educate students on the risk associated With e-Waste and approprite Waste disposal Technique, LPU routinely hosts awareness Campaing
            It encourages a responsible e-klasel managemerit Culture on Campus. Coming to Collabrations To quarantee Secure and effective processing, LPU Collaborates With approved e-Waste processing buissness, and e-Waste disposal. These programmes show how Comitted LPU is to encouraging Sustainable, Safe quarding the environment and managing ewide responsibly.
            
            The improper disposal of e-waste poses serious hazards because it has a noticeble Worldwide impact on the air, Water, and soil of the planet. The following are few issues related to e-Waste:-</p>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of Awareness: The biggest challange is that most students, faculty and staff are unaware of dangers Created by the inappropriate disposal of e-waste. They are not aware that toxins Substances Can be found in e-waite, Causing harm to humans health and the environment during improper disposal. Many disposed of them in a Carefree manner and left them in a certain storage for Such a long time without recycling.
            </li>
            <li>Limited number of Collection Centres :- LPU dosen't have enough collection Centres for the disposal of e-Wašle. should Collection Centres be difficult to access. Then it would not be easy for the students, and staff to dispose of electronics items that are old or not working properly. That may lead people to resort to improper methods Or perhaps hoard them</li>
            <li> No formal tie-ups with government Certified e-Waste recyclers: To date, LPU does not have any formal tie-ups with the government Certified e-Waste recyclers. Since the lecyclers are government
                Certified, it ensures safe extention of hazardous materials from e-Wase recyclers. Since the recyclers are government Certified e-Waste recyclers, it ensures Safe extintion of hazardous materials from e-Waste and utilization of functional components throught refurbishment or recycling. Thus, due to a lack of Such tie-ups, most of the e-wastes are handed over to the informal Channels Where Sale disposal is not ensured</li>
            <li>Most of the e-Waste generated at LPU was found to be handed over to local Scapers dealers who indulged in hazardous recycling Practice and released large quantities of-toxic Substance in the environment, Contaminating Soils and Water resources.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Innovations From E-Waste</h2>
        <p>Cirrus: It helps in Segregating e-scraps from plastics and Other Such materials. It is as innovation and uses high resolution NIR (Near Irifrared) Serisors. It also has Colour Sensors and has all metal detector. The equipment does work efficiently and as per requirement to make the Segregration work easy. Using this machine can boost up Speed and action-based Sensor System metal sort out fine metal particles from the e-waste that includes glass, e-scraps, plastic flakes etc. It is highly reliable and requires minimal expenditure on maintainance. There are different Size available based on your requirement.

            From the E Waste the different items Could be formulated for Eg:- Ecofashion, Necklaces and Earring, shoes, Brooches, pieces of Art, Furniture, Bill Boards, Bio grow devices, Cufflinks and Pins. Apart from these there are many more items that one Can make from these Wastes.
            
            There is techndogy that exists in Germany. invented by a private recycling Company, that grinds electronic devices into a fine, se Sugar-like form and then chemically separates the precious metals, plastics, resins and Sillica back into marketable material streams</p>

        <h2>Managment</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>

        <li>Look for Safer and more formal recycling Companies with legal Certification or license because many informal Companies are involved in illegal practices.</li>
            
        <li>Increase the life duration of your device by saving data online or any cloud backup. Buy electronics in exchange for older ones.</li>
            
            <li>Avoid dumping e-Waste in the open field, Which is very harmful to health, Such as the lungs, heart and kidneys or evern it Can Cause Some Severe illness.</li>
            
            <li>Avoid all informal means of dumping e-Waste</li>
            
            <li>Do not try to dismantle elecbonic (or) electrical items by yourself.</li>
            
            <li>Repurposing old devices before purchasing new ones. Think aboul what to do with the older item before purchasing the new item.</li>
            
            <li>Join/Contact e-waste management Companies to take care of your old item.</li>
            
            <li>Follow government quidelines and policies On e-Waste for better understoning.</li>
            
            <li>Buy Only extreme necessary electronic items to reduce the hefty burden of dangerous e-Waste.</li></p>

        <h2>Benfits of Sustainable Development</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            An effective e-waste management System at LPU would Contribute to multiple aspect of sustainable development:
            <li>Environmental Protection: E-Waste Will not leak harmful chemicals to soil, Water or air which means that pollütion and damage to the environment locally will decrease.</li>
            <li>Conservation of Resources: Recycling of e-wasle allows Value materials like metal and plastics to be recovered and does not form a need to extract them by mining. This helps in better resource efficiency and engy saving
            </li>
            <li>Economical Opportunities: In this regards, in Cooperation with accredited recylers, LPU, On the one hand, ensures Safe disposal of e-waste and, on the other hand, offers economic opportunities in the form of green jobs and Partnership.
            </li>
            <li>An Example:- As an educational institution, LPU Can also be a role model for other Campuses by adopting a responsible e-wastle management system. This would give a sense of sustainability among the students and Would Geate a chain reaction when they start working</li>
        </ul>
